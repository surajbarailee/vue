Vue js is a JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK that makes building interactive and reactive web frontends easier.

Different Ways of Utilizing Vue:
    Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages
        Widget approach on a multi-page-application. (Some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server
    Vue can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web application
        Single Page Application (SPA) approach. Server only sends one html page,thereafter,Vue takes over and controls the UI


How Vue Works :



Proxy in javascript


ref = "abcd"
$refs 


How vue updates a dom?
    JS-based Virtual DOM exists only in memory
    Updates are made to the virtual DOM first only differences are then rendered to the real DOM



Vue App lifecycle:


createApp({...})
beforeCreate()
Created() 
    Compile Template
beforeMount()
mounted()
    Mounted Vue Instance -> Data Changed -> bedoreUpdate() -> Updated()
                            Instance Unmounted -> beforeUnmount() -> unmounted()
